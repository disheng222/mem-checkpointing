	abstract = {In this paper we describe Buffered Coscheduling, a new approach to design  the system software of large scale parallel computers. A buffered coscheduled  system can tolerate inefficient programs, programs that have communication and  load imbalance, and can substantially increase the resource utilization, by overlapping  computation, communication and I/O over several jobs. In addition to that,  Buffered Coscheduling creates a framework to easily implement fault-tolerance,  arguably the most important problem to solve to build usable, large scale parallel  computers.},
