	abstract = {Existing techniques manage power for the main memory by passively monitoring the memory traffic, and based on which, predict when to power down and into which low-power state to transition. However, passively monitoring the memory traffic can be far from being effective as idle periods between consecutive memory accesses are often too short for existing power-management techniques to take full advantage of the deeper power-saving state implemented in modem DRAM architectures. In this paper, the authors proposed a new technique that will actively reshape the memory traffic to coalesce short idle periods - which were previously unusable for power management - into longer ones, thus enabling existing techniques to effectively exploit idleness in the memory.},
