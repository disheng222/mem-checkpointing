	title = {{MARSS}: {A} full system simulator for multicore x86 {CPUs}},
	shorttitle = {{MARSS}},
	abstract = {We present MARSS, an open source, fast, full system simulation tool built on QEMU to support cycle-accurate simulation of superscalar homogeneous and heterogeneous multicore x86 processors. MARSS includes detailed models of coherent caches, interconnections, chipsets, memory and IO devices. MARSS simulates the execution of all software components in the system, including unmodified binaries of applications, OS and libraries.},
