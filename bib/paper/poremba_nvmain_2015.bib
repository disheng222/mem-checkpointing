	abstract = {In this letter, a flexible memory simulator â€“ NVMain 2.0, is introduced to help the community for modeling not only commodity DRAMs but also emerging memory technologies, such as die-stacked DRAM caches, non-volatile memories (e.g., STT-RAM, PCRAM, and ReRAM) including multi-level cells (MLC), and hybrid non-volatile plus DRAM memory systems. Compared to existing memory simulators, NVMain 2.0 features a flexible user interface with compelling simulation speed and the capability of providing subarray- level parallelism, fine-grained refresh, MLC and data encoder modeling, and distributed energy profiling.},
