	abstract = {Phase Change Memory (PCM) has emerged as a promising alternative of DRAM to provide energy-efficient and high-capacity memory for high performance servers. A new DRAM + PCM hybrid memory architecture has been proposed to leverage PCM's high density and DRAM's robustness and performance. One of the big challenges of PCM is its limited write endurance (10{\textasciicircum}7 {\textasciitilde} 10{\textasciicircum}8 times per cell). By knowing the association between DRAM and PCM, malicious software can easily force DRAM cache to be flushed continuously, which produces writes to certain PCM cells repeatedly (known as selective attack) and wears out PCM. Although existing wear-leveling approaches could evenly distribute writes under selective attack, the overall endurance of PCM is still severely impacted, and therefore it is suboptimal. In this paper, we propose Cache Address Remapping (CAR), that can adaptively remap DRAM cache address, to hide the association between DRAM and PCM. Moreover, CAR can minimize the write-back traffic to PCM under selective attack by uniformly distributing the writes to a single cache set into different cache sets. We propose a practical and low overhead implementation of CAR, called RanCAR. Experimental results show that CAR could reduce DRAM cache miss rate by {\textasciitilde}4600x under selective attack, and prolong PCM lifetime from several minutes to 13.8 years on average.},
